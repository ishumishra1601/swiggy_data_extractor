# Extracting Top 50 Restaurants Details in Any City from Swiggy Using Python and Beautiful Soup

## Project Overview
This project aims to extract the details of the top 50 restaurants in any city from Swiggy using Python and Beautiful Soup. The project uses web scraping techniques to extract data from the website 'https://www.swiggy.com/' and stores the data in a CSV file.

## Methodology

### Web Scraping
The first step in the project involved web scraping the data from the website 'https://www.swiggy.com/'. This step involved identifying the relevant HTML tags and attributes to extract data such as restaurant name, cuisine, address, stars, and cost for 2.

### Data Cleaning
The second step involved cleaning the extracted data to remove any unwanted characters or spaces. This step involved using Python's built-in string manipulation functions to clean the data and prepare it for analysis.

### Storing Data
The third step involved storing the extracted data in a CSV file. This step involved creating a pandas dataframe and using the 'to_csv' function to store the data in a CSV file.

### User Input
The fourth step involved taking user input for the city whose restaurant details the user wants to extract. This step involved using Python's 'input' function to take the city name as input from the user.

### Automating the Process
The final step involved automating the entire process using a Python script. This step involved using Python's Beautiful Soup library to extract data from the website, cleaning the data, storing it in a CSV file, and taking user input for the city name.

### Results
The project successfully demonstrated how to extract the details of the top 50 restaurants in any city from Swiggy using Python and Beautiful Soup. The extracted data can be used for further analysis or for making informed decisions about which restaurants to visit or order food from.
